abstract: Bushfire is the primary destructive force that may cause damage to a
  large region, a country, or even the Earth. However, as bushfires spread too
  fast, they are often identified when they cannot control and cause significant
  damage. The reason is that existing works on remote sensing focus on low-level
  information processing, and thus, face the challenge of processing a massive
  amount of data in real-time. In this work, we employ complex event processing
  (CEP) to extract higher-level information to facilitate real-time bushfire
  detection. In particular, we propose a “spatial extension” to the
  ready-powerful CEP techniques to enable bushfire monitoring from the
  combinations of multiple spatial events. We further demonstrate the proposed
  spatial-based CEP on a real-time bushfire detection problem. Experimental
  results illustrate that our approach scales well while achieving the
  competitive detection performance.
