abstract: From the end of 2019, one of the most serious and largest spread
  pandemics occurred in Wuhan (China) named Coronavirus (COVID-19). As reported
  by the World Health Organization, there are currently more than 100 million
  infectious cases with an average mortality rate of about five percent all over
  the world. To avoid serious consequences on people‚Äôs lives and the economy,
  policies and actions need to be suitably made in time. To do that, the
  authorities need to know the future trend in the development process of this
  pandemic. This is the reason why forecasting models play an important role in
  controlling the pandemic situation. However, the behavior of this pandemic is
  extremely complicated and difficult to be analyzed, so that an effective model
  is not only considered on accurate forecasting results but also the
  explainable capability for human experts to take action pro-actively. With the
  recent advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, the emerging
  Deep Learning (DL) models have been proving highly effective when forecasting
  this pandemic future from the huge historical data. However, the main weakness
  of DL models is lacking the explanation capabilities. To overcome this
  limitation, we introduce a novel combination of the
  Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased (SIRD) compartmental model and
  Variational Autoencoder (VAE) neural network known as BeCaked. With pandemic
  data provided by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and
  Engineering, our model achieves 0.98 ùëÖ2 and 0.012 MAPE at world level with
  31-step forecast and up to 0.99 ùëÖ2 and 0.0026 MAPE at country level with
  15-step forecast on predicting daily infectious cases. Not only enjoying high
  accuracy, but BeCaked also offers useful justifications for its results based
  on the parameters of the SIRD model. Therefore, BeCaked can be used as a
  reference for authorities or medical experts to make on time right decisions.
