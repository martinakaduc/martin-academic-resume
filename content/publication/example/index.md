abstract: A prosthesis is an equipment provided to people who lost one or some
  parts of their limbs to help them having almost normal behaviors in daily or
  hard activities. The convenience and intelligence of devices should create
  easiness and flexibility for users. Artificial devices require
  interdisciplinary collaboration from neurosurgeons, surgical surgeons,
  physiotherapists and equipment development. Computer engineering plays a
  crucial role in the design step, supporting manufacturing, training and
  recognition to match the desirability of customers. Moreover, users need a
  wide range of different options such as an aesthetic functional material, a
  myoelectric mechanism, a body-powered appliance or an activity specified
  device. Thus, the flexible configuration, the proper features and the cost are
  some important factors that drive user's selection to the prosthesis. In this
  article, we describe an effective and powerful solution for analyzing,
  designing hardware and implementing software to train and recognize hand
  gestures for prosthetic arms. Moreover, we provide evaluation data of the
  method compared with similar approaches to support our design and
  implementation. This is fairly a complete system, making it a convenient
  solution for hand-cutoff people to control prosthetic hands using their
  electromyography signals. Statistical results with evaluations show that the
  device can respond correspondingly and the method creates promisingly
  recognition data after correct training processes. The prosthetic hardware
  implementation has also been simulated using a Light-emitting diode (LED) hand
  model with a high accuracy result.
