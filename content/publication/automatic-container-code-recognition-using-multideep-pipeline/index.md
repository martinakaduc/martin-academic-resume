abstract: Identification of license plates on intermodal containers (or
  containers) while entering and departing from the yard provides a wide range
  of practical benefits, such as organizing automatic opening of the rising arm
  barrier at the entrance and exit to and from the site. In addition, automatic
  container code recognition can also assist in thwarting the entrance of
  unauthorized vehicles into the territory. With the recent development of AI,
  this process is preferably automatic. However, the poor quality of images
  obtained from surveillance cameras might have detrimental effects on AI
  models. To deal with this problem, we present a pipeline dubbed as MultiDeep
  system, which combines several state-of-the-art deep learning models for
  character recognition and computer vision processes to solve problems of real
  camera data. We have also compared our results with other pipeline models on
  real data and accomplished fairly positive results. In this paper, without
  further references, we will only consider intermodal containers when referring
  to them as containers.
